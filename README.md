# fluttermovies

A Flutter sample app based on the tutorial [From Wireframes to Flutter #1 - Movie Details Page](https://flutter.rocks/2017/09/12/from-wireframes-to-flutter-movie-details-page/)

The app uses [themoviedb](https://api.themoviedb.org) backend to fetch latest movies and displays meta information like rating and storyline.

## Getting Started

To run the app you need to create a [TMDb account](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and use your API key in the config.dart file.

Copy/Rename the sample_config.dart file to config.dart and add your own API key.
